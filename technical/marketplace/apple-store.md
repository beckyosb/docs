# Register Developer Account - Enrolling as an Organization

## Requirements:

1. **An Apple device**, such as an iPhone, iPad, or Mac computer to complete Apple’s two-factor authentication process. Apple requires two-factor authentication for all Apple IDs and requires Developer Account Holders to sign in to their Apple Developer account using two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication is built directly into iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and Apple websites which all require an Apple device such as an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 9 and later, or a Mac with OS X El Capitan or later. See, [Apple’s Support: Two-Factor Authentication](https://developer.apple.com/support/authentication/) to learn how to set up two-factor authentication on your Apple device.
1. **An Apple ID**. You can create an Apple ID using either your personal email address or an email address associated with your business. When creating an Apple ID, keep in mind that Apple will use the email address you choose to bill the annual $99 (USD) publisher fee and email you app updates. Follow this link to learn [how to create your Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204316). Be aware that creating an Apple ID is not the same as creating an Apple Developer account.
1. **An email address**. You can begin your enrollment in the Apple Developer Program using a personal email address, such as yourname@gmail.com, but Apple will eventually require you to provide a private email that uses the domain name associated with your business’s website, such as email@yourbusiness.com.
1. **D-U-N-S® Number**. A D-U-N-S Number is a unique numeric identifier assigned to a business by Dun & Bradstreet (D&B). It is used by Apple to validate your business’s identity and legal status. You cannot enroll in the Apple Developer Program without a D-U-N-S Number. To acquire a D-U-N-S, see [Requesting a D-U-N-S Number](https://developer.apple.com/support/D-U-N-S/) on the Apple Developer website. Keep in mind that the information you submit when requesting a D-U-N-S Number must match the information you submit when enrolling in the Apple Developer Program. For example, the legal entity name for your business must be spelled and stylized the same way in both enrollment forms. After you acquire a D-U-N-S Number, you can use the [D-U-N-S look up tool](https://www.dnb.com/duns-number/lookup.html) to pull up your D-U-N-S Number and related information at any time.
1. **A business website URL**. We recommend using a publicly available website with a domain name associated with your organization.
1. **Verification call**. After you submit the necessary information to enroll in the Apple Developer Program, Apple will call you to verify your information. During this call, you must be able to provide Apple with your D-U-N-S Number and the information you used to request a D-U-N-S Number. You must also be able to show Apple your business information (such as your business location addresses and business hours) on your own website.
