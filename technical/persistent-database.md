Hey! This is not actually an oversight, Fasten is still under heavy development, and we're not yet able to guarantee backwards compatibility between versions.

You can add a bind mount to the following directory within the Fasten container to persist the database: `/opt/fasten/db/`

So just add `-v /my/host/directory/here:/opt/fasten/db/` to the existing docker run command.

However, please note that this may cause incompatibilities between versions (and you may need to completely delete your database to fix it)
