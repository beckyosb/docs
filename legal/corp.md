# Corp

- [Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas) to incorporate?
  - **Why?** It's not my primary priority, but I am hesitant to sign healthcare provider TOS and agreements under my name. 
  - Stripe Atlas's registration fees seem pretty reasonable. 
    - $500/y1, $100/y after 
      > Starting a company in Delaware is largely picking a name, picking an agent, and filing a form with payment. 
      > The recurring costs relate to paying your agent, paying your accountant, and paying Delaware its $300/year. 
      > (Technically you can do the accountant part yourself if you don't have income (and it is not included in the Stripe plan), 
      > but the agent part needs to be someone with a physical address in Delaware)

Corps aren't just more work, they require more knowledge about what you are doing. You are a shareholder, officer, and 
director and each has liabilities and obligations. I can't just tell you what those are because the answer is going to 
be a lot of "it depends". You may be fine, but it can also be an expensive mess.
At the end of the day do what makes you comfortable, as you can be successful with either, and can be well protected with 
either. Just be careful about where you get your advice as there is a lot of just wrong information people take as true on the internet.

## LLC
- dont use your house address (do you want to be your own registered agent = NO)
	- if you get sued, it pierces the corp veil if you are the corp agent
	- use a registered agent (Stripe Atlas provides)
- LLC is super easy, fast, easy to maintain. no BS documents
- LLC with foreign qualification
	- $300 taxes in Delaware
	- $1800 taxes in CA
		- 800$ + 125$ registered 
- Possible to convert Delaware LLC to a CCorp
- as a sole proprietier, you can write off taxes
	- eg 100k LLC profit is personal income
	- you can write off losses and expenses to get tax deductions
- Very tax efficient


## CORP
- Minutes required

- packages. 
- Taxes are more complicated
	- even 1$ is taxed
